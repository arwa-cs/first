            <p class="intersting">Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The
                protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form
                cocoons.The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm
                Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture).<br><br> The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the
                triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at
                different angles, thus producing different colors.</p>

            <p class="intersting">Tweed is a rough, woollen fabric, of a soft, open, flexible texture, resembling
                cheviot or homespun, but more closely woven. It is usually woven with a plain weave, twill or
                herringbone structure. Colour effects in the yarn may be obtained by mixing dyed wool before it is
                spun.

                Tweeds are an icon of traditional Scottish, Irish, Welsh and English clothing, being desirable for
                informal outerwear,due to the material being moisture-resistant and durable. Tweeds are made to
                withstand harsh climates and are commonly worn for outdoor activities such as shooting and hunting,
                in England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.
